## Goal
---
open the file called "-" to view the contents

## Plan
---
`cat ./-`
or the more versatile should work??
`cat < -`

## Walk Through
---
I use `ls -l` to view all the files.
I see there is only the `-` file and do research on how to access the file.
I find that you can open single word files by including `./` in `cat`
