## Goal

Find the password stored in the file in the inhere directory
## Plan
---
`cd inhere`
`ls -A`
`cat ...Hiding-From-You`

## Walk Through
---
I `cd inhere` to view all he files.
I use `ls -la` to view the files and find the file but has ... which confused me, due to being used to windows' single . for hidden files. I also find the . and .. directories.
I find the `-A` option for `ls` to see the full name and hide the extra directories
I use my new found knowledge for the `cat` command
