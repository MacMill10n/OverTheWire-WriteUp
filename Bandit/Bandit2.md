## Goal
---
open the file called "--spaces in this filename--"
## Plan
---
`cat < "--spaces in this filename--"`

## Walk Through
---
I use `ls -a` to view all the files.
I try `cat "--spaces in this file name--"` and find it doesn't work, so i do research in ways to use `STIn` with `cat`.
I find how to use `<` with `cat`
