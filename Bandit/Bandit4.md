## Goal
---
Find the password in the only human readable file in the inhere directory
## Plan
---
`cd inhere`
`ls -h`
`cat < [file]`

## Walk Through
---
I `cd inhere` and `ls -l` to view all the files.
I brute force `cat [file]` until i find the correct file.
In the next task i find the `-h` option and realise I could have optimised this level instead of brute forcing it
