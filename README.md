# OverTheWire-WriteUp
My personal walkthrough of OverTheWire and how I solved and completed the levels.

These writeups are used to show my thought process and solved the levels I have completed thus far.
The writeups are made in Obsidian using markdown and pushed to github after removing the credentials to the levels.

All the levels do not have any of the answers as per accordance with OverTheWire Rules.

All credit belongs to OverTheWire.org
